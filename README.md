Analysis of Covid-19 Lockdown Measures

o Situation: SARS-CoV-2 has impacted sustainability and global economy, while lockdowns, vaccination, testing, and policy coordination aided response. Choose better model to implement these efficiently.

o Task: To find multiple critical types of relationships between daily cases and lockdown measures.

o Action: Collected data, built 3 different Time-Series model vaccination only, lockdown measures only and combination vaccination and lockdown measures.

o Result: The combination vaccination and lockdown measures model have the lowest RMSE of approximately 1.63 million with best predictive accuracy.



Conclusion: 

Positive/Negative Correlation: A positive correlation means that stricter lockdown measures were associated with more cases, while a negative correlation suggests the measures were effective in reducing cases.

Lagged Effect: If time-lagged analysis shows stronger correlations, this implies lockdown measures had delayed effects. 

Regression: Regression analysis will help quantify the contribution of each measure.
